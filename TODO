== TODO ==

Do we want to return json root for nested arrays?

e.g.
{customer: {firstName: 'Dan', creditCards: [{creditCard: {...}}]}}
or
{customer: {firstName: 'Dan', creditCards: [{...}]}}

---

* do we want to add a _details suffix?
* keep version below 1.0 until it's fully featured
* do feature comparison to ruby library
* write the docs
